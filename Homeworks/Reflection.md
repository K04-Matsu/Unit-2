## Relection: Comparison of Langauges

Throughout this first half of the 2021 academic year, we have mainly focused on Python and C plain when it comes to coding a project. Now that we have reached the turning point of grade 11, I would like to compare the two languages we have learned through my own personal experience.  
First we have started with one of the most general languages, Python. For running Python based programs, we have used pyCharm and Colaboratory. Colaboratory was great when it came to collaborating with other coders. However, the running speed of the code was fairly slow and crashes often. PyCharm was overall a great platform to run Python codes, and so my experiences are based on PyCharm Python. As expected, Python is a very friendly coding language for beginner programmers. Additionally, since Python is one of the most famous programming languages, there were plenty of resources available for actual code writing and instructions. The simplicity is also a big advantage of the Python, especially for English speakers, the Python has easy to understand syntaxes. For the cons, as far as I have experienced, I was not able to find any. Although, through some research, I have found out that the simplicity was also a disadvantage.
